This is an implementation of a modified Astar algorithm in C for the Pathfinder project in MREN 178 at Queen's University.

Can compile and run this code normally. If the destination-passenger pairs are random, go into gridStructure.c and set RANDOM to 0 at the top of the file to turn on user input.
